# Introduction_to_Machine_Learning-Project
## Project description:
A telephone company has found out that many of their subscribers use legacy plans. They want to develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of newer plans: Smart or Ultra.\
You have access to behavior data about subscribers who have already switched to the new plans (from the project for the Statistical Data Analysis course). \
For this classification task, need to develop a model that will pick the right plan. Since youâ€™ve already performed the data preprocessing step, you can move straight to creating the model.\
Develop a model with the highest possible accuracy. In this project, the threshold for accuracy is 0.75. Check the accuracy using the test dataset.
